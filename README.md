### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm H. Kamran! ðŸ‘‹

Here's what I'm currently working on:
  - My website, [hkamran.com](https://github.com/hkamran80/website) ([available here](https://hkamran.com)), which has my blog, a list of my creations, and some little programs made for the web
  - [Schedules](https://github.com/hkamran80/schedules) ([available here](https://schedules.unisontech.org), [beta](https://beta-schedules.unisontech.org)), which just underwent a complete redesign, and gives you the time left in a period and when that period ends. Currently only available for AUHSD Standard and Distance Learning schedules
  - An EPUB reader for macOS, called [Xenon Reader](https://github.com/hkamran80/xenon-reader).
  - A controller for Spotify, [Control Surface for Spotify](https://spotify-controlsurface.unisontech.org)
  - A simple diary application, powered by Firebase, called [Diario](https://diario.unisontech.org/)
  - A help center library for iOS (with [aheze](https://github.com/aheze)) called [SupportDocs](https://github.com/aheze/SupportDocs)
