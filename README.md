### Hi there, I'm H. Kamran! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on [Schedules](https://github.com/hkamran80/schedules) ([available here](https://schedules.unisontech.org)) and Buzzloop. I'm also working on a diary application called [Lockbook](https://github.com/hkamran80/lockbook) (which I need some help with, specifically encryption and decryption), a read-later bookmark site named [Remembrance](https://github.com/hkamran80/remembrance). For more information, check out my personal website at [hkamran.com](https://hkamran.com)!

My favorite programming languages are Python, Swift, and JavaScript. If you want to check out the few articles I've written, view them on [Medium](https://medium.com/@hkamran80) or [Reprint](https://reprint.hkamran.com) (my personal Medium mirror)! If you need to contact me, email me using the email listed on my profile or send me a message on Twitter (link on profile)!
