### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm H. Kamran! ðŸ‘‹

Here's what I'm currently working on:
  * [Schedules](https://github.com/hkamran80/schedules) ([available here](https://schedules.unisontech.org)), which is currently under going a complete redesign
  * A diary application called [Lockbook](https://github.com/hkamran80/lockbook) (which I need some help with, specifically encryption and decryption of user information and data)
  * A read-later bookmark site named [Remembrance](https://github.com/hkamran80/remembrance)

If you want to check out the userscripts I've written, head on over to my [userscripts site](https://userscripts.hkamran.com)!
