### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm H. Kamran.

I'm currently working on [Schedules](https://github.com/hkamran80/schedules) and Buzzloop. I'm also working on a diary application called [Lockbook](https://github.com/hkamran80/lockbook). For more information, check out my personal website at [hkamran.com](https://hkamran.com)!

My favorite programming languages are Python, Swift, and JavaScript. Use the contact form on my Medium mirror, [Reprint](https://reprint.hkamran.com), to contact me!
