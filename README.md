Here's what I'm currently working on:
  * [Schedules](https://github.com/hkamran80/schedules) ([available here](https://schedules.unisontech.org), [beta](https://beta-schedules.unisontech.org)), which is just underwent a complete redesign (hacktoberfest)
  * The redesign of my blog, [Reprint](https://beta-reprint.hkamran.com) ([legacy version](https://reprint.hkamran.com))
  * A diary application called [Lockbook](https://github.com/hkamran80/lockbook) (which I need some help with, specifically encryption and decryption of user information and data) (hacktoberfest)
