## Projects

I work on too many projects to put into a full list, but a pretty accurate one can
be gleaned by scanning through [my repositories](https://github.com/hkamran80?tab=repositories).

### Featured Projects

- **[Ramadan Tracker](https://13willow.com/project/ramadan-taskminder?utm_source=ghprofile)**:
  Stay on task for Ramadan!

  Ramadan Taskminder allows you to stay on top of your tasks for Ramadan. Keep track
  of your Qur'an reading and other key tasks.

  Ramadan Taskminder currently supports tasks and logging your Qur'an reading. All
  data is stored on your device, and is not synced anywhere. No diagnostics or analytics
  is collected.

  You can download it from the [Apple App Store (iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6446471761?pt=125715921&ct=GitHub&mt=8)
  and the [Google Play Store (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thirteenthwillow.ramadantaskminder&utm_source=website&pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1).

- **[Schedules](https://schedules.unisontech.org)**: All your bell schedules in
  one app

  Schedules gives you handy information about your bell schedules, such as the current
  period, the countdown to the next period, and the starting time of the next period.
  For each school, Schedules sends handy notifications at predefined intervals and
  features a full bell schedule for each day of the week.
  
  If your school is not yet available, [request its addition](https://go.unisontech.org/schreq)
  or add the schedule yourself by forking the
  [configuration repository](https://github.com/hkamran80/schedules-configuration)
  and making a pull request.

  Schedules is entirely open-source, with [the website](https://github.com/hkamran80/schedules),
  [mobile apps](https://github.com/hkamran80/schedules-flutter/), and [configuration](https://github.com/hkamran80/schedules-configuration)
  available in separate repositories here on GitHub.
